\title{Calculate the maximum along an axis}
\usage{
rray_amax(x, axes = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector, matrix, or array to reduce.}

\item{axes}{An integer vector specifying the axes to reduce over. \code{1} reduces
the number of rows to 1, performing the reduction along the way. \code{2} does the
same, but with the columns, and so on for higher dimensions. The default
reduces along all axes.}
}
\description{
\code{rray_amax()} computes the maximum along a given axis or axes. The
dimensionality of \code{x} is retained in the result.
}
\details{
Currently, objects are coerced to \code{rray}s before the reduction is applied.

\examples{

x <- rray(1:10, c(5, 2))
