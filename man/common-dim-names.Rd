\title{Find common dimension names}
\usage{
rray_dim_names_common(...)

rray_dim_names2(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, y, ...}{Objects to find common dimensions for.}
}
\description{
Obtain a common list of dimension names among a set of objects. For
interactive use, \code{rray_dim_names_common()} is more useful.
}
\details{
\code{rray_dim_names_common()} is the engine that determines what dim names should
be used in the result of arithmetic operations and other functions that
involve multiple rray or mtrx objects and return a single result.

The rules for determining the set of common dim names between objects
\code{x} and \code{y} (in that order) are:
\enumerate{
\item Compute the common \code{dim} between \code{x} and \code{y} using \code{rray_dim_common()}.
\item For each dimension along the common \code{dim}, if \code{x} has dim names for that
specific dimension and the size of the names is the same as the size
of the dimension, use them.
\item If \code{y} has dim names for that dimension, and the size of the names
is the same as the size of the dimension, use them.
\item If there are no dim names found, then the result is \code{character(0)}.
}
}
\examples{
library(magrittr)

# 1x2 - Row names but no column names
x <- rray(1, dim = c(1, 2)) \%>\%
  set_row_names("r_from_x")

# 1x1 - Row names and column names
y <- mtrx(c_from_y = 1) \%>\%
  set_row_names("r_from_y")

# 1x1 - Row names but no column names
z <- mtrx(1) \%>\%
  set_row_names("r_from_z")

# Combining y and z
# y has names for both dimensions
# so they are used
rray_dim_names_common(y, z)

# Combining z and y
# - Row names are found first from z
# - But z has no column names
# - So column names are found from y
rray_dim_names_common(z, y)

# Combining x and y
# - Row names are found first from x
# - x has no column names
# - y has column names
# - But they are different length from
#   the common column dimension (2)
# - No column names are used
rray_dim_names_common(x, y)
